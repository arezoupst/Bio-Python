# **Biopython Tools - Clean & Simple**

This repository contains a collection of Biopython-based tools and tutorials for handling various bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence manipulation, alignment, and structure analysis. The repository has been cleaned up and enhanced while keeping the original simplicity.

## **Project Structure**
- **data/**: Contains example datasets like FASTA files (e.g., chimpanzee mRNA).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for demonstrating projects and including examples.
- **Tools & Examples/**: Your original bioinformatics tools and projects (chimpanzee, databases, etc.).
- **projects/**: Simple notebook versions of your original projects (5 projects).

## **Original Projects (Preserved as Tutorials)**

### 1. **Chimpanzee mRNA GC Content Analysis**:
   - Retrieve chimpanzee mRNA sequences using Entrez.
   - Perform GC content analysis on the large mRNA dataset.
   - Simple visualization and analysis tools.

### 2. **Nucleotide Search and Retrieval**:
   - Use Entrez to search and retrieve specific nucleotide sequences from databases like NCBI.
   - Using other Databases like Expassy and Swissprot.
   - Simple cross-database search capabilities.

### 3. **Protein Structure Analysis**:
   - Fetch protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
   - Perform structure analysis and visualization using Biopython tools.
   - Basic structural analysis features.

### 4. **Pairwise Sequence Alignment**:
   - Perform global and local sequence alignments to analyze sequence similarity.
   - Example alignment of nucleotide sequences (chimpanzee mRNA vs. human mRNA).
   - Simple alignment visualization.
