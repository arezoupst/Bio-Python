# **Biopython Tools**

This repository contains a collection of Biopython-based tools and tutorials for handling various bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence manipulation, alignment, and structure analysis.

## **Project Structure**
- **data/**: Contains example datasets like FASTA files (e.g., chimpanzee mRNA).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for demonstrating projects and including examples.
- **tools/**: Python scripts implementing bioinformatics tools using Biopython(Mostly tutorial).

## **Features**
- **Sequence Manipulation**: Reverse complement, transcription, translation, GC content calculation.
- **Sequence Alignment**: Global and local alignment for nucleotide and protein sequences.
- **Database Retrieval**: Fetch sequences from NCBI databases (e.g., chimpanzee mRNA).
- **Protein Structure Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze protein structures from PDB.
- **Sliding Window GC Content**: Analyze GC content in sliding windows across large datasets.
- **File Format Conversion**: FASTA, GenBank, and other bioinformatics formats.

## **Example Projects**
1. **Chimpanzee mRNA GC Content Analysis**:
   - Retrieve chimpanzee mRNA sequences using Entrez.
   - Perform GC content analysis on the large mRNA dataset.

2. **Nucleotide Search and Retrieval**:
   - Use Entrez to search and retrieve specific nucleotide sequences from databases like NCBI.
   - Using other Databases like Expassy and Swissprot.
 

3. **Protein Structure Analysis**:
   - Fetch protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
   - Perform structure analysis and visualization using Biopython tools.

4. **Pairwise Sequence Alignment**:
   - Perform global and local sequence alignments to analyze sequence similarity.
   - Example alignment of nucleotide sequences (chimpanzee mRNA vs. human mRNA).

## **Requirements**
To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
