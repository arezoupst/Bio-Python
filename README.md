# **Biopython Tools - Clean & Simple**

This repository contains a collection of Biopython-based tools and tutorials for handling various bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence manipulation, alignment, and structure analysis. The repository has been cleaned up and enhanced while keeping the original simplicity.

## **Project Structure**
- **data/**: Contains example datasets like FASTA files (e.g., chimpanzee mRNA).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for demonstrating projects and including examples.
- **Tools/**: Python scripts implementing and tutoring bioinformatics tools using Biopython.
- **Example Projects/**: Original projects including chimpanzee analysis and database usage.

## **Original Projects (Enhanced but Simple)**

### 1. **Chimpanzee mRNA GC Content Analysis**:
   - Retrieve chimpanzee mRNA sequences using Entrez.
   - Perform GC content analysis on the large mRNA dataset.
   - Simple visualization and analysis tools.

### 2. **Nucleotide Search and Retrieval**:
   - Use Entrez to search and retrieve specific nucleotide sequences from databases like NCBI.
   - Using other Databases like Expassy and Swissprot.
   - Simple cross-database search capabilities.

### 3. **Protein Structure Analysis**:
   - Fetch protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
   - Perform structure analysis and visualization using Biopython tools.
   - Basic structural analysis features.

### 4. **Pairwise Sequence Alignment**:
   - Perform global and local sequence alignments to analyze sequence similarity.
   - Example alignment of nucleotide sequences (chimpanzee mRNA vs. human mRNA).
   - Simple alignment visualization.

## **Simple Notebook Enhancements**

### 5. **Sequence Analysis** (`notebooks/01_sequence_analysis.ipynb`)
   - Basic sequence manipulation and analysis
   - Simple statistical analysis and visualization
   - Clean, readable code in notebook format

### 6. **Database Integration** (`notebooks/02_database_integration.ipynb`)
   - Simple interface to NCBI databases
   - Basic search and retrieval functions
   - Clean error handling in notebook format

### 7. **Metagenomics Analysis** (`notebooks/03_metagenomics_analysis.ipynb`)
   - Basic metagenomic analysis tools
   - Simple quality control and classification
   - Clean visualization in notebook format
